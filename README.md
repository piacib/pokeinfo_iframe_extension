## Why I built the project this way


## What I learned from this project

This project has been a valuable learning experience for me, as it has allowed me to explore the world of web extensions and gain proficiency in developing them. Through this project, I have acquired knowledge and skills in using URL search parameters to establish communication and share information with external websites. 

One of the key takeaways from this project has been the ability to manipulate web page elements using pure JavaScript. I have learned how to dynamically add, remove, and edit elements on a webpage, which has greatly enhanced my understanding of web development principles and practices.

Additionally, I have gained insight into the procedures involved in submitting, reviewing, and updating applications for third-party platforms. This knowledge has proven invaluable as it has equipped me with the necessary know-how to navigate the app development process effectively. Being familiar with these procedures ensures that my applications meet the required standards and enables me to provide timely updates and bug fixes when necessary.
